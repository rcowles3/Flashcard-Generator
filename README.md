# Flashcard Generator
This is a backend application that creates basic flashcards through the use of JS constructors. 

### Overview

The backend will essentially constitute an API that allows users to create two types of flashcards.

1. **Basic** flashcards, which have a front (_"Who was the first president of the United States?"_), and a back (_"George Washington"_).

2. **Cloze-Deleted** flashcards, which present _partial_ text (_"... was the first president of the United States."_), and the full text when the user requests it (_"George Washington was the first president of the United States."_)

### Examples

```
var firstPresident = new BasicCard(
    "Who was the first president of the United States?", "George Washington");

// "Who was the first president of the United States?"
console.log(firstPresident.front); 

// "George Washington"
console.log(firstPresident.back); 

var firstPresidentCloze = new ClozeCard(
    "George Washington was the first president of the United States.", "George Washington");

// "George Washington"
console.log(firstPresidentCloze.cloze); 

// " ... was the first president of the United States.
console.log(firstPresidentCloze.partial); "

// "George Washington was the first president of the United States.
console.log(firstPresidentCloze.fullText): "

// Should throw or log an error because "oops" doesn't appear in "This doesn't work"
var brokenCloze = new ClozeCard("This doesn't work", "oops");
```
